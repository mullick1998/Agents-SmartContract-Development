The proposed application of this research was to build a decentralized supply chain network with various agents interacting with one another and smart contracts regulating the exchange of information and products. As a result, the supply chain process would be more transparent, traceable, and effective.

According to the research described in this thesis, the merge of both technologies can be achieved by combining a library for interfacing with the Ethereum blockchain and a \ac{BDI}-based framework. Combining these two technologies enables the development of intelligent agents that can communicate and store the interactions in the form of transactions using smart contracts and perform steps depending on data stored on the blockchain.

This thesis has shown the possibility of merging \ac{BDI}-based multi-agent systems with blockchain technology, specifically smart contracts. The \ac{BDI} model provides a strong foundation for developing intelligent agents capable of making decisions based on their beliefs, desires, and intentions, while blockchain technology and smart contracts provide a safe and decentralized platform on which these agents can interact. The findings of this study might pave the way for the creation of new decentralized applications and \ac{MAS} in various domains.
