{\chapter{Further Work}}
As a part of our ongoing effort, it will amazing enhance the functionality of our application and build an interactive user interface. Another area of future research may be looking at how different \ac{BDI} frameworks handle agent coordination and communication in a \ac{MAS}, and how they can be connected with blockchain technology and smart contracts. This could entail investigating various architectures and protocols for agent communication and assessing their influence on the system's overall performance and scalability. One can experiment with \ac{BDI} frameworks such as JACK or 2APL for developing agents in multi-agent systems and connecting them with blockchain technology like smart contracts. We also anticipate to have a successful implementation of our program using the web3j library, maybe after a significant upgrade to JASON or ASTRA, so that the application can operate using these Java-based languages too.

Furthermore, investigating the influence of various \ac{BDI} frameworks on system security and the capacity to deal with malicious agents would be an essential subject of future research. It would also be interesting to examine the usage of \ac{BDI}-based multi-agent systems for additional blockchain technology use cases, such as decentralized banking and prediction markets. Future studies may also look at other blockchains outside Ethereum, such as Hyperledger, and Corda, to see how well the method works with various blockchains.

Finally, it would be intriguing to examine the integration of other future technologies such as \ac{IoT}, \ac{AI}, and 5G with the proposed system to improve the functionality and performance of the supply chain network.
