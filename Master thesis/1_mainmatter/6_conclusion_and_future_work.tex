\label{sec:conclusion}

In this thesis, we discussed about the \ac{MAS} and \ac{BCT}, which are well-known technologies that will likely be employed in the future in a significant supply chain sector. We provide an implementation and a sample regarding the creation of smart contracts with JASON \ac{BDI} agents, whereby the smart contracts are constructed using Solidity, the agents are developed with the JASON Python-based interpreter, and both are integrated with the web3 package.

As part of our ongoing efforts, we may expand the functionality of our program and create a fantastic user interface, which will allow us to modify the code and make it usable. In order to utilize the web3j package, we also anticipate having a successful implementation with our other choices, maybe following a significant update in all the other languages we tried to employ that include a Java-based interpreter.
