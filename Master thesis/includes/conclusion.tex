\chapter{Conclusion}

In this thesis, we discussed about the \ac{MAS} and \ac{BCT}, which are well-known technologies that will likely be employed in the future in a significant supply chain sector. We provide an implementation and a sample regarding the creation of smart contracts with Jason \ac{BDI} agents, whereby the smart contracts are constructed using Solidity, the agents are developed with the Jason Python interpreter, and both are integrated with the web3.py package.
