\section{Incompatibility Issues}
Jason's and some issue with web3 libraries gave the opportunity to switch from Solidity to Vyper and learn more about the language. Because Vyper lacks \textit{Modifiers}, \textit{Class Inheritance}, \textit{Inline Assembly}, \textit{Function Overloading}, \textit{Operator Overloading}, and \textit{Binary Fixed Point}, a thorough examination of Vyper prompted us to chose Solidity once more. The usage of the following constructs might result in confusing or challenging to comprehend code, hence they are not included.
